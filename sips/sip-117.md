## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Enable synth exchanging on L2 via Optimism

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

After a multi-phase, incentivised testnet trial, Synthetix went live on the Optimistic Ethereum (OΞ) mainnet. However, this was an intitial soft launch, i.e. L2 users could only stake SNX and issue or burn sUSD. The implementation of this SIP enables actual synth exchanging on L2.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

As described in [The Optimistic Ethereum Transition](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-optimistic-ethereum-transition), Phase 0 enabled users to lock SNX, and mint an equivalent amount via a Syntehtix to Optimism bridge. However, the L2 functionality is limited to staking SNX, issuing sUSD and claiming weekly rewards. Additionally, both SNX and sUSD are not transferable, due to an initial security related restriction imposed by OΞ.

Now that this limitation is about to be lifted, and with the upcoming support of Chainlink oracles, all the necessary conditions are met for enabling synth exchanging and making the transition to Phase 1.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--  -->
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

No new contracts were developed. The OΞ Synthetix instance, namely `MintableSynthetix` was enhanced with exchanging functionality. The basic Synthetix functionality that is supoorted on both layers is implemented on a parent contract (`BaseSynthetix`) which is inherited by the L1 (Synthetix) and the l2 (MintableSynthetix) instances.

> Note: A `BaseDebtCahce` contract was introduced in order to state the shared functionality between DebtCache and RealtimedebtCache more explicitly.

The following functions are to be activated on L2 `Synthetix`:

1. `exchange() `
2. `exchangeOnBehalf()`
3. `exchangeWithTracking()`
4. `exchangeOnBehalfWithTracking()`
5. `settle()`

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The polymorphic approach adopted during the L2 integration (check [SIP-102](./sip-102.md) for further details) proved to be very efficient. For basic exchanging functionality the functions that needed to be added are the following: `exchange()`, `exchangeOnBehalf()`,`settle()`. Additionally, even though in Phase 1 it will not be of any use, we propose to also enable exchange partner volume tracking functionality ([SIP-63](./sip-63.md)) i.e. `exchangeWithTracking()`,`exchangeOnBehalfWithTracking()`, so it will be already available when more projects move to OE. Their implementation is moved from `Synthetix` to `BaseSynthetix` since they are going to be available on both layers.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

N/A

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

TBD

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
