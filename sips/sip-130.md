## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
The introduction of the Spartan Council into the SIP governance process has generated a number of new states that a SIP can occupy. This SIP proposes a new workflow to augment the ones proposed in SIP-1, SIP-93 and SIP-104.  

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
The current flow for a SIP is below:
```
[ WIP ] -> [ PROPOSED ] -> [ APPROVED ] -> [ IMPLEMENTED ] X [ REJECTED ] 
```
This SIP proposes a new flow:
```
[ DRAFT ] -> [ FEASABILITY ] -> [ SC REVIEW PENDING ] -> [ VOTE PENDING  ] -> [ APPROVED ] -> [ IMPLEMENTED ]
                                                                         -> [ REJECTED ]
                                                                         -> [ FEASABILITY ]
```


## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->
Following the implementation of SIP-104 a number of issues have arisen. The original SIP workflow worked well but over time a number of conventions have emerged that require additional states. The most important of these is the introduction in SIP-104 of a Spartan Council review meeting between various stakeholders in the SIP process, where the SIP Author must present the SIP to the Council, providing them an opportunity to interrogate any issues the SIP might introduce as well as the risks associated with the change. In adition to this by convention most SIPs would have a core contributor as a champion in the past, however, as more community SIPs have been proposed a process is now required to ensure the Council can communicate the priotisation of all open SIPs to the core contributors. This state has been named feasibiluty where the Core Contributors and Spartan Council will agree to assign an engineer to assess the feasibiity of a community SIP alognside the SIP author.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
The existing states are replaced by the states below and these states will need to be implemented on the SIPs website or the SIPs website will need to be upgraded/replaced in the future to ensure these states are handled.

DRAFT (The initial state of a new SIP before the Spartan Council and core contributors have assessed it)
FEASABILITY (Once assessed a SIP is moved into Feasability and a CC is assigned)
SC REVIEW PENDING (Once the Author and the CC doing the feasbility study are satisfied a SIP is in Spartan Council Review Pending)
VOTE PENDING (Once the Spartan Council has formally reviewed the SIP during the SIP presentation they can either move it to a vote or send it back to Feasability)
APPROVED (If a vote is successful the SIP is moved to Approved, otherwise it is Rejected)
REJECTED (If a vote is not successful the SIP is moved to Rejected)
IMPLEMENTED (Once implemented on-chain the SIP is moved to Implemented state)


### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
The introduction of the new states ensures that at all times all stakeholders know where in the SIP workflow a SIP is and what the next steps are. This will help with coordination efforts as the CC and SC now span multiple timeszones so ambigous states lead to significant uncertainty and inefficiency.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
N/A

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
